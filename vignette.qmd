## Abstract

This vignette explores how logistic regression and random forest models can classify household density categories (urban, suburban, exurban, rural) using data from the 2010-2012 California Household Travel Survey (CHTS). The dataset includes variables such as household demographics, travel behaviors, vehicle ownership, parking preferences, work schedules, toll lane usage, and active travel modes. By employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we reduce the dataset's high dimensionality, distilling numerous variables into a manageable set of key components that retain the most significant variance. Logistic regression, known for its interpretability, is then used to model the relationship between these principal components and household density categories, providing insights into how demographic and travel behavior variables influence classification. In contrast, random forest, an ensemble learning method, is employed to explore complex, non-linear relationships within the data, leveraging decision tree structures to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Datasets

We are working with 3 datasets: `hh_bgDensity.Rds`, `HHData_111A.Rds`, `PersonData_111A`. `hh_bgDensity.Rds` contains 3 columns and 36,925 observations that include an identification number for each household, numerical value of the density of the surrounding area that the household is in, and the classified household density category (urban, suburban, exurban, rural). `HHData_111A.Rds` contains 17 columns and 36,925 observations which contain categorical and numerical information about each household such as city, county, and household size. `PersonData_111A` contains 17 columns and 36,925 observations that include demographic information on the head-of-household. The 3 datasets have been merged on the household identification number (`hhid`) into a new dataset, `personHHData`, to contain all household information.
