#Reading In Data/Merging Datasets

#Quick Plot
```{r}
plot(county_shp["NAME"])
```
The unique colors correspond to the unique names of each county. However, you will notice that there are repeat colors because the color palette available when plotting in such a simple way is limited.

#We will now be taking some of the CHTS person and household characteristics and aggregating them to the county level so we can map the traits of our CHTS respondents county-by-county.

#To start off, letâ€™s get the total count of how many people in our survey come from the various counties of California:
```{r}
personHHData %>% 
  group_by(CTFIP, County) %>% #added County to this grouping so we can see the county names
  summarise(count=n()) %>% 
  view()
```

```{r}
prhh_aggreg <- personHHData %>% 
  group_by(County, CTFIP) %>%
  mutate(count = n()) %>% # the new column called 'count'
  summarise_at(vars(-hhid, -pnum, -bg_group), mean)

View(prhh_aggreg)
```

```{r}
county_prhh_shp <- county_shp %>% left_join(prhh_aggreg)
view(county_prhh_shp) # check the data to see what we get
```


# Map of the percentage of CHTS respondents born in the USA per county.

```{r}

        legend = TRUE, # if FALSE, it won't show the legend
